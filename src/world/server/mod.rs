/**
	Provides session info for authentication.

	### Trigger
	Receipt of [Server handshake](crate::general::client::Handshake).

	### Handling
	Verify with your auth server that the `(username, session_key)` combination is valid. If not, immediately disconnect the client, ideally with a [`DisconnectNotify::InvalidSessionKey`](crate::general::client::DisconnectNotify::InvalidSessionKey).

	If you are concerned about players modding their client DB, also check the [`fdb_checksum`](Self::fdb_checksum). Note that players can still change their client to send a fake checksum, but this requires exe modding, which most players are presumably not familiar with.

	If all validation checks pass, store the connection -> username association, as this is the only packet that references the username.

	### Response
	The client does not require a fixed response to this packet. However, world servers (with the exception of a dedicated char server) will usually want to respond to this with [`LoadStaticZone`](super::client::LoadStaticZone).

	### Notes
	**Important**: Do **not** handle any other packets from clients that have not yet been validated. Handling other packets before validation can lead to errors because the connection has not yet been associated with a username, and can lead to security vulnerabilities if session keys are not validated properly.

	The player entering a string in the chat box. This message is sent as the player is typing, before pressing enter.

	This message is only for quick player feedback on acceptability. Final string submissions by the player will be sent in different messages (e.g. [`GeneralChatMessage`] or `Mail` (todo)).
